# Hibernate Projects (All project having CRUD opretions)

This repository contains various Hibernate projects that I've developed while learning and implementing different concepts from  basic to advanced . hibernate

## Project 1: HibernateProject_With_Img

Description: This project features the capability to upload multiple images directly into the database. Images are stored in the database, and users can view them within the application. This functionality serves as a key feature for an upcoming major project.

## Project 2: hibernate_CRUD

Description: This project encompasses all the fundamental concepts of Hibernate. It includes various operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Hibernate's built-in methods like save, update, and delete. The project demonstrates how to perform SQL operations without writing manual SQL queries by leveraging Hibernate's support.

## Project 3: Hibernate_miniProject_DAOStruc_CRUD

Description: This mini-project incorporates five operations: GetAll, Get single student based on ID, Delete, Update, and Insert. These operations are performed based on user input. The project follows the DAO (Data Access Object) structure commonly used in the industry.

## Project 4: Hibernate_DAO_StructureEmployee

Description: This project showcases CRUD operations within the Hibernate framework. It reflects the learning and implementation journey in Hibernate.

## Project 5: Hibernate_All_Criteria_RestrictionClass

Description: This project demonstrates the usage of Criteria interface's built-in methods, specifically focusing on the Restrictions Class to manipulate data. Methods such as gt (greater than), lt (less than), eq (equals to), Between, Like, and IN are utilized.

## Project 6: Hibernate_OneToOne_MappingDB

Description: This project focuses on implementing One-to-One relationships between two tables in a database. It consists of two entities: Questions and Answers, establishing a relationship where each question corresponds to only one answer. Advanced annotations like @OneToOne are employed within the Hibernate framework to achieve this relationship.
